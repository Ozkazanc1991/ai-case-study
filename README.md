### Deep 6 AI: An Emerging AI Company In The Field Of Medicine

**Background**
AI is having more impact in the world we live in today, as all sectors of life will feel this change. One of the major industries that is experiencing this impact is the world of medicine. In the last decade, new technology companies have emerged in this sector, because health care plays a vital role in all of society. The world of health care is already experiencing the use of AI as it continues to have an impact on treating patients all over the world. According to PWC, over the next decade, more and more information on healthcare will become available to us therefore, AI will play a vital role in analyzing/storing all that data for better patient treatments along with a faster turnaround time. And finally, AI will be a primary influence in the next decade as it is finding more and more innovations solutions at a faster rate, but also more safety, based on the data and criteria.  

The following is just a few areas where AI is having an impact in the world of medicine:
>Improved patient care
>Streamlined processes in a variety of areas
>New drug discovery
>Faster diagnosis
>Improved treatment

Deep 6 AI, founded in 2016 by Wout Brusselaers in Pasadena, California, is one of the companies to watch for in the next decade, as AI continues to develop and mature in this sector. The goal of this company is to speed up the clinical trial process efficiently, using their AI technologies. A clinical trial is the process that a new treatment undergoes (drug, device, etc.), before it is approved for use in humans, in a safe & effective manner. This process historically has taken a long time; therefore, Deep 6 AI's goal is to speed up this process via their new technology. 

The company received an estimated $45 million in funding so far and the goal from the start, was to speed up the clinical trial process to bring lifesaving treatment to millions of patients.

**Company Mission & Activities**
Deep 6 AI employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Machine learning (ML) software to analyze large amount of data during the clinical trial which, historically, tended to take several years. Today, they are one of the pioneers in this industry to help address the challenges posed in the clinical trial process. 

Deep 6 AI's primary intended customer base is:
>Hospitals
>Doctors
>Patients
>Pharmaceutical Companies

According to the company, while AI is having a major impact in healthcare, some processes such as research and data operations' are not progressing as fast because many hospitals and medical centers still rely on the slow manual data processing and are very inefficient. Therefore, in order to improve this situation, the company saw an opportunity with the use of AI, to get lifesaving treatments in a much faster manner. 


**Solutions**
The company mines the large amount of clinical data (both structed & unstructured) to match potential patients to clinical trials in a much faster rate. The main AI technology they use are NLP and ML. The following are some of the innovative practices that it employs:
>Using NLP & ML on both structured & unstructured data to match patients to the clinical research trials
>It dives deeper into the data to extract vital information such as age, gender, medical records, ICD-10 (diagnosis code) and LOINC codes
>Also taps into unstructured data such as unorganized notes, lab results, medical records
>Precision match the patients to the clinical trial based on the above criteria

The performance & metrics of Deep 6 AI and how they are unique, from others fall into the following three reasons according to their official website:
>They process unstructured data as 80% of all medical data is unstructured and Deep 6 AI prides themselves as a pioneer in this field; the software they employ is able to read this data along with the structured data collected
>Due to the ability of their software, they are able to go through both structured & unstructured data, the process is sped up from a more manual one to one much more efficient; one of the main reasons a failed clinical trial occurs is due to the inability to find patients therefore, the recruitment goals are not met. The software is able to take a process that would have taken months, if not years, finds the right patients in minutes due to the ecosystem built by them
>The NLP & ML software make it possible for researchers to understand the data and to find the vital information as needed, in a manner of minutes

**Results**
According to their official website, Deep 6 AI reports the following results from their services:
>Accrue patients 3X faster than other sites and 23 million total so far
>Users who utilize Deep 6 AI spend 50% less time identifying patients
>20 health systems currently are the software
>Sites find 25% more patients than the prior traditional methods because, their software(s) delving into the structured data
>From the wealth of unstructured data there is (lab results, clinical notes, older forms, etc.), an understanding that this data is critical and to evaluate a patient's eligibility; 15-20% more eligible patients are identified via the unstructured data alone

Due to their innovative solutions, the company also has had a significant impact on the business activities in the healthcare sector. Here are some of the ways it has had an impact:
>Faster clinical trials due to the software used
>Saving money because their software screens better patients reduces recruitment costs
>Better trial success rates
>Better insight into the data research


**Competition**
Like in all fields, there are competition & alternatives to Deep 6 AI; the following are some (if not all) competitors for Deep 6 AI in recent years:

>Pentavere Research Group-AI based tool that helps mine electronic health records & unstructured data
*>Deep 6 AI has raised more money (45 compared to 1.79) and has a more increased study recrutiment & reduced times and fewer failed studies*

>TriNetX focuses on real-world data and access to de-identified patient records, datasets, etc. whose primary customer is healthcare organizations & life sciences companies
*>Deep 6 AI is a newer company while also building a ecosystem that allows hospitals to find potential patients faster based on that AI tools they use*

>Neuroute specializes in designing & executing clinical studies, clinical planning, selection of sites, etc.
*>Deep 6 AI has raised more money (45 million compared to $100K) & has a much more reduced time speed to reach the needed target recruitment*

>Maya AI creates an AI data robot that analyzes data and helps in decision making for multiple industries
*>Deep 6 AI specializes in healthcare & has raised more money*

These are just a few competitors that Deep 6 AI faces and as AI develops more & more in healthcare, there will be more compeition. However, so far, against most of its competition, Deep 6 AI has raised far more money which indicates that people trust this company and the results have further validated this deicsion. Also, the company's main advantage is its focus on AI to automate the tedious clinical trial process as other companies may have different goals within the industry. This will prove vital going forward in terms of the impact Deep 6 AI has in its business activities because the more it grows, the more funding it will raise to continue & improve the solutions it provides to its customers. 

**Recommendation**                                                                                                                       
While Deep 6 AI has provided a number of great solutions, there is always room for improvement. The cornerstone of their solution involves the use of NLP & ML software to help better match potential patients during the clinical trial process at a much faster rate. While the speed of the matchmaking is efficient, the quality of the patient & the results will matter more going forward as more and more patients will be classified using this software. For example, if a pharmaceutical company is testing a new drug for treatment, one of the criteria's is how effective it is on a given patient; however, there are different levels of pain that the patient maybe experiencing. Therefore, using its current AI technologies (NLP & ML) for its software, Deep 6 AI should put in specific criteria's for each patient's pain level that the individual maybe experiencing. More detailed criteria produces better patients care which can help the clinical trial process get approved faster. Better results are how Deep 6 AI can continue to show themselves as a pioneer in this sector which will help them exponentially grow and continue to get more funding to develop their technologies. During this process, 90% of all tests fail and between 40%-50% of failures are due to inefficient clinical efficacy, as the drug was not able to produce the expected results.

The AI software should factor in extensive detailed criteria on the patient selection process to better gauge the effectivness the treatment is as there can be several potential factors. 

Example: Treatment For Knee Pain

Criteria for patient (grading score to be incorporated in software to select for clinical trial test treatment):
>patient has knee pain when he sits
>patient has knee pain when just sitting & no movement
>patient has knee pain right away when he stands up
>patient has more knee pain after five minutes walking
>patient has more knee pain after thirty minutes of activity
>patient has more knee pain after only after an entire day of activity

More specific grading criteria can help identify better qualified patients who need specific treatment and this will avoid a more random selection in the software. Relying on AI software always poses some risk, especially, early on, so therefore, the more specific results it can produce that are quantifiable, this will lead to more hospitals & pharmaceutical companies comfortable in trusting this program. So, if Deep 6 AI can assure these concerns with future customers, this will lead to more extensive growth in the future.
